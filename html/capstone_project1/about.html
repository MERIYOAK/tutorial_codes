      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Meron Michael and I'm a clinical lab scientist, accountant, and
        web developer. Yes, you read that right. I have three different careers
        and I love them all. I'm always looking for new challenges and
        opportunities to learn new skills. That's why I decided to get into web
        development a few years ago. I enjoy creating beautiful and functional
        websites that showcase my creativity and problem-solving abilities. I
        work as a clinical lab scientist and an accountant. I help diagnose
        diseases and manage finances for various organizations. I'm originally
        from Eritrea. I love exploring new cultures and meeting new people. I'm
        always open to new projects and collaborations in web development. If
        you're interested in working with me or just want to say hi, feel free
        to contact me through my website. I look forward to hearing from you!
